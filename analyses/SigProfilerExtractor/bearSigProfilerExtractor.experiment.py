# so the docs say that ref genome only matters if working from vcf

# trying to run both ways and see what happens? are there different reference signatures?

# I am getting different answers with human vs mouse ! tell Kelley for her work 
# upping replicates to 500 from 100 to hopefully get more stability

# how did Kelley deal with that? 
# does ref genome matter here? try with diff ref genomes to find out; it should according to the docs
