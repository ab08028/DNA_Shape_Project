# fin whale : already has them masked from vcf. could rerun it on them anway; or could get from Meixi
# vaquita: JAR provided file
# bear : needs to be run
# dog/mouse/human can I find from UCSC? 
# so maybe just run on fin whale and bear 

# to download on UCSC: table browser --> choose version of genome --> all tracks --> CpG islands --> bed format --> name file/gzip --> download and xfer to sage
# doing for: mouse, minke, human, dog
# running for: bear
# have from JAR: vaquita
# NOTE FOR MINKE WHALE: cpg islands were wrong chrom names from ucsc, but meixi converted them so use her version of cpg islands (updated excel file)

# so just need to get cpg islands for the brown bear:
# going to run with default params: seems similar to what ucsc does
