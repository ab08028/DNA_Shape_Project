########## run trf ##########
#running trf:
# recommended settings:
##trf yourfile.fa 2 5 7 [keep as is] 80 10 [keep as is] 50 2000 <-- change to 12 to match UCSC
# only thing changing from trf defaults is last parameter: period size (size of repeat itself, not number of copies)
# setting to 12 to match UCSC 
#1. File: The sequence file to be analyzed in FASTA format (see for details). Multiple sequence in the same file are allowed.
#2. Match, Mismatch, and Delta: Weights for match, mismatch and indels. These parameters are for Smith-Waterman style local alignment using wraparound dynamic programming. Lower weights allow alignments with more mismatches and indels. A match weight of 2 has proven effective with mismatch and indel penalties in the range of 3 to 7. Mismatch and indel weights are interpreted as negative numbers. A 3 is more permissive and a 7 less permissive. The recomended values for Match Mismatch and Delta are 2, 7, and 7 respectively.
#3. PM and PI: Probabilistic data is available for PM values of 80 and 75 and PI values of 10 and 20. The best performance can be achieved with values of PM=80 and PI=10. Values of PM=75 and PI=20 give results which are very similar, but often require as much as ten times the processing time when compared with values of PM=80 and PI=10.
#4. Minscore: The alignment of a tandem repeat must meet or exceed this alignment score to be reported. For example, if we set the matching weight to 2 and the minimun score to 50, assuming perfect alignment, we will need to align at least 25 characters to meet the minimum score (for example 5 copies with a period of size 5). [not sure if should keep as is ?] 
#5. Maxperiod: Period size is the program's best guess at the pattern size of the tandem repeat. The program will find all repeats with period size between 1 and 2000, but the output can be limited to a smaller range. [[[ In UCSC this is set to 12 ]]]
